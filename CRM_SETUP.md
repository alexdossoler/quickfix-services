## üí∞ Cost Analysis

### Self-Hosted Option
- **Monthly Cost**: $10/month (DigitalOcean droplet)

### ROI Calculation
```
Current Manual Process:
- 30 minutes per lead (sorting, assigning, following up)
- 50 leads/month = 25 hours @ $30/hour = $750/month

With EspoCRM Automation:
- 5 minutes per lead (just qualification call)
- 50 leads/month = 4.2 hours @ $30/hour = $125/month
- Savings: $625/month - $25 CRM cost = $600/month saved
```

## üîÑ Lead Lifecycle in EspoCRM

### 1. Lead Creation (Automatic)
```javascript
// Website form submission triggers:
{
  name: "John Smith",
  email: "john@example.com", 
  phone: "704-555-0123",
  service: "plumbing",
  urgency: "emergency",
  address: "123 Main St, Charlotte, NC",
  message: "Burst pipe in kitchen",
  leadScore: 85, // Auto-calculated
  status: "New"
}
```

### 2. Auto-Assignment & Tasks
```javascript
// Workflow triggers create:
- Assignment to appropriate technician
- Follow-up task (timing based on urgency)
- Email notification to assigned user
- Customer acknowledgment email
```

### 3. Lead Qualification
```javascript
// Technician contacts customer:
- Confirms service details
- Provides quote
- Schedules appointment
- Updates lead status to "Qualified"
```

### 4. Opportunity Creation
```javascript
// Qualified leads become opportunities:
- Estimated revenue amount
- Probability of closing
- Expected close date
- Service package details
```

### 5. Service Delivery & Follow-up
```javascript
// Post-service automation:
- Mark opportunity as "Closed Won"
- Create customer satisfaction survey
- Schedule follow-up for future maintenance
- Add to customer service history
```
